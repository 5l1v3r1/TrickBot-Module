  Modules overview

  TrickBot has an embedded list of command and control servers and a list of “must-have” plugins. First, it contacts the
  servers to retrieve these plugins, as well as an updated list of command and control servers and an additional list of
  servers, used only for downloading purposes. After these initial actions, it awaits further instructions. One command is
  to start a certain plugin. If that plugin does not exist, it uses the list of download servers to retrieve it first, then it loads
  the plugin and executes the indicated exported function (from the command). As a persistence mechanism, some of
  the plugins are loaded automatically when TrickBot malware is started, without waiting for a command from the C&C
  servers. 
 
  During the last 6 months of close monitoring and gathering statistics about this threat, our systems were able to
  retrieve updates for several different active plugins, gathered around different functionalities, proving to have all the
  right tools to perform an end-to-end attack:


 • Lateral Movement
   • WormDll/mWormDll/tWormDll - a worm component responsible for spreading into the local network via SMB by
     exploiting through EternalBlue
   • TabDll - uses EternalRomance to spread into the network via SMB
   • ShareDll/mShareDll/tShareDLL - remote service manager using stolen credentials to install remote services on
     other computers from the network
 
 • Reconnaissance
   • SystemInfo - collects information about the affected system 
   • NetworkDll - performs network mapping
   • Psfin - meant to identify POS-related terminals inside the compromised domain
 
 • Collection
   • ImportDll - collects varying browser information such as cookies or browser configuration
   • Pwgrab - steals credentials from various applications
   • aDll – steals active directory credentials
 
 • Setting Foothold
   • NewBCtestnDll – performs reverse proxy and executes commands
   • VncDll – used by the attacker as RAT, giving the option to remotely view and control the victim’s computer
 
 • Exfiltration
   • Mailsearcher - searches for files with certain extensions (usually document files)
 
 • Financial data theft
   • InjectDll – used to steal financial information through webinjects by monitoring various banking websites
 
 • Credential Access
   • RdpscanDLL – performs bruteforce attack on a certain list of targets (indicated by the attacker)
   
 
  Some of these plugins can have configuration files, which serve varying purposes. If needed, they will be retrieved from
  the command and control servers. Some of those retrieved by our researchers are described below:
 
   • dinj – configuration file for injectDLL plugin, containing information about targeted financial institutions; the attack
     uses server-side injections
   • sinj - configuration file for injectDLL plugin, containing information about targeted financial institutions; the attack
     uses redirections (also known as web fake injections).
   • dpost – also used by the injectDLL module, containing a list of servers; the stolen financial information is sent to
     one of the servers from this list
   • mailconf - used by mailsearcher for exfiltration
   • srv - used by rdpScanDLL as a list of C&C servers
   • vncconf - used by vncDLL and rdpScanDll for as a list of C&C servers
